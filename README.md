# Dataman
CTS-285 Group 2
For this project we tried to recreate the Dataman product using Python. 
To begin using the program the first thing you will need to do is open the menu.py file and run the module. 
The user should be greeted by our menu for Dataman, and from there the have the option to select each of our files.
You have the option of Answer Checker, Memory Bank, Number Guesser, and Pop Quiz. 
However, for the Pop Quiz option you will need to have created a csv file. We have included one in the program if one has not already been made.
A csv file can be created with notepad++ and even Excel. The user would then need to add the file into the program folder where all the other features are being held.
To select other options the program will need to be run for each time the user wants to which to use a different feature.
Lastly, please enjoy using our creation of Dataman.
